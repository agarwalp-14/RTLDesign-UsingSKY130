# RTLDesign-UsingSKY130
This is a summary of the RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop that I was a part 

# Day 2: Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient 
## Introduction to timing.libs
The name of the library file name:
- sky130 is the name of the library
- **tt** stands for typical 
- 025C is the temperature
- 1v8 is the volatage

PVT(process, voltage and temperature) are the factors that determines how the Silicon works.
Process is the variations due to fabrication.
